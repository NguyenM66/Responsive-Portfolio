          <img src="assets/images/profpic.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Monica Nguyen">

         	<p class="bio"> I graducated from UCF in 2011 with a Bachloers in Electrical Engineering. I currently work for a small R&amp;D company and have been there for the last 5 years. I work mainly on IR cameras and sensor integrated denial devices. I have alot of experience in, but not limited to, PCB layout, IPC level soldering and deposition/processing of Silicon Wafers. I also previously worked for a government contract company working on simulated weapons for the military.</p>

    		  <p class="bio"> I'm a gun and knife enthusiast, I ride a motorcycle and dirt bike on occasion. I love my car Samuel, he's a white wrx. And most of all I LOVE to spend all my freetime traveling as much as I can, eating as much amazing food as I can, cause there is no point in eating something that isn't life changing, and just striving to have a happy and healthy quality of life.</p>
